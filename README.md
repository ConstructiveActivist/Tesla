This repository seeks to lower de noise around Teslaâ€™s valuation and its forward-looking assumptions. We aim to facilitate collaboration to activate collective intelligence. This process started by gathering and labeling all available quantitative and qualitative data from leading market participants. The collected information is tabulated in the Tesla Models. xlsx, where you will find assumptions from the buy, sell, short, and independent analysts side. For instance, buy-side analysts tabs (i.e, ARK Invest) are colored green, while sell-side (i.e, Morgan Stanley) are in blue, short-side are in red and independent analyst are in yellow. Every user is encouraged to include their model and assumptions in the file. We invite all market participants to join a fact-based constructive discussion. This exercise should increase the odds of adequately valuing this asset and efficiently updating its evolution quarter by quarter.
